# A little project that strives to convert python-to-minecraft

Library in the 'generation_lib' folder

### Development is halted until my other project, 'Procedure Crafter', is working. This side project can generate code in a visual workspace and is crucial for creating custom java code

## But what version of Minecraft?

- Any version
- Any mod loader

## How does it work?

- It receives the concept of what you want to make and generates code based on a plugin system for the specified versions
