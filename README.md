# A little project that strives to convert python-to-minecraft

Library in the 'ender_py' folder

Installation/Usage guide:

- Copy repository to local disk
- Install any currently supported mdk and make sure you can run it at least once
- Edit main.py to point to the parent directory of the unpackaged mdk
- Run main.py to test if generation works fine
- Make your own creation

### Development is halted until my other project, 'Procedure Crafter', is working. This side project can generate code in a visual workspace and is crucial for creating custom java code

## But what version of Minecraft?

## Final words

This is **not** a magic library that replaces pure Java modding. It's essentially a proof of concept created because working with MCreator is about as effective as asking your cat to fetch your TV remote.

Having said that;
this project sucks,
Java causes me physical pain,
and I have no idea where all these ghost features are come from.

**Nonetheless, it miraculously works!** If you come across any bugs or issues, _please_ hesitate to create an github issue. Your feedback is invaluable.
